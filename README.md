Validate forms using JS

## Goals

- Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields.
- Use live inline validation by highlighting the field red and an error
  message.
- Don't actually submit to any backend but should give an error message if the
  button is pushed with any active errors or unfilled required fields.
